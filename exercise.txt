1. What is HTTP?
HTTP is Hypertext Transfer Protocol - it's the protocol that is used for web documents.  It's a way of transmitting documents via the internet.  It's frequently used for communication between web browsers and web servers.
2.  URL
Uniform Resource Locator -- Contains the Protocol, Domain, Document - It's the address where a document is listed on the internet.
3.  What is DNS?
DNS is the human-readable format for an IP Address.  
4.  What is a query string?  
Query String is the small string put at the end of a URL that contains stuff like a key-value pair that you may be searching for, or certain parameters for the site.
5.  What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?
GET allows you to retrieve a document, without modifying it or leaving any side effects, typically by placing a URL in the browser.  POST allows you to modify a document, with arguments typically sent in the body of the request.
6. What is an HTTP Request?
An HTTP Request is the request that a computer sends to a server to request information/documents/files/etc.
7. What is an HTTP Response?  
The Response is the data that is returned from the server following the request, which is then typically rendered by the Browser.
8. HTTP Header is the parameters for the Request/Response, that provides information such as the language, the format (html, json, etc), the type of request (GET, POST, etc), Cookies, etc.
Another common response header is Content-Type.
9.  When you type a URL into a browser, the Browser parses the URL for the DNS, and attempts to locate the IP address.  It then makes a request for information from that URL, in this case in a GET request.  The server will then typically reach out to a database server for more information, get the information from the database, and return the database to the user in the form of a RESPONSE.  The browser will then render the response, typically in the form of an HTML document.
